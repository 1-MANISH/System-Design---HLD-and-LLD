Encapsulation in C++

What is Encapsulation?
        ➡️Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.

         ➡️It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of [data Security].

         ➡️Only the necessary information is exposed, and the rest is hidden from outside interference and misuse.

Access Specifiers

        private: Members are accessible only within the class.

        protected: Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.
        
        public: Members are accessible from outside the class.

Getters and Setters

        Public methods to access (get) or modify (set) private data members.

Benefits

        Increased security of data.
        Better control over data.
        Flexibility and maintainability.
